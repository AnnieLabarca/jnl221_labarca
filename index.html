		<h2>Homework part one: Creative dataviz critique</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following creative dataviz stories, and carefully consume it, both text and creative elements. Make sure you spend time fully with each element. Then, critique it. Below the instructions, you should write the name of the project inside an h3 tag, and write at least three paragraphs and insert them below inside three separate p tags. Don't forget to close your tags!</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these projects:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/" target="_blank">Data breach hacks</a>, Information Is Beautiful</li>
			<li><a href="https://pudding.cool/projects/vocabulary/" target="_blank">Hip hop vocabulary</a>, The Pudding</li>
			<li><a href="https://drones.pitchinteractive.com/" target="_blank">Drones dropped in Pakistan</a>, Pitch Interactive</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-7464500a-6368-4029-aa41-ab94e0ee09fb" target="_blank">COVID deaths through sound</a>, BBC</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Answer <i>at least</i> the following questions, and be thorough and detailed in your responses: Where is the data from in this project, and what dataviz/graphics/visual elements are used? What do you think is the key message of this dataviz project? Describe the different ways in which this dataviz project is effective at conveying its key message. Mona Chalabi talks about her dataviz projects being visceral, or having to do with deep, internal feelings rather than the intellect, in order to be memorable -- in what ways do you feel this dataviz project was visceral?</p>

		<h3> The Largest Vocabulary in Hip Hop </h3>
		<p> The project I chose was “The Largest Vocabulary in Hip Hop” by Matt Daniels. The project focused on the number of unique words rappers have used in their lyrics. It was recently updated in 2019 to reflect some of the newer, bigger rappers. The first 35,000 lyrics of a rapper’s songs were considered, and those that did not have the necessary amount were unfortunately left out. The lyrics were studied and reviewed on Genius, a media annotation site. The biggest problem with this project was the lack of a clear definition of what a “unique” word was (the grammar was discussed, but not the meaning). 
		The project has three major dataviz elements that are visually appealing to the eye, showing ranges of unique words by decades, how the data compares to other genres and a lineup of individual artists. All internalize the fact that hip hop has changed and evolved in the way that old school rappers became famous for certain bars while newer rappers can use the production of their song to reel more fans in. This project is notable because Daniels gives enough sufficient reading material and background to go with the dataviz parts without it being overwhelming. Two of the three dataviz elements are color coded, making it completely clear what information is being shared.
	This project could be considered visceral in the sense that it caters to an audience that is nostalgic towards rap as a genre. When comparing the old sound to the new, there is a kind of fondness towards the way songwriting used to be, as some people today would argue that there was more creativity. Even put more simply, it’s fun to potentially see your favorite artist represented at large. Music as a whole is visceral, as it evokes certain feelings and memories right away. Daniels successfully combined those feelings with an entertaining display, which is why it was noteworthy. </p>




		<h2>Homework part two: Datawrapper chart</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following datasets -- one of which we've used in the past -- to create one, fully complete Datawrapper chart or map, that reflects at least one finding from this dataset. Insert it below the instructions inside an iframe tag.</p>
		<p>Attributes of a fully complete Datawrapper chart: Hed, subhed, data source, alt text, legend, byline, any notes about data limitations or details, any annotations that you feel help convey your finding(s). Remember: your finding should be reflected in either your hed or subhed, and an explanation of your data (where it's from, what it collects, etc.) should be reflected in the other. You must choose colors from a color palette generator; you may not use Datawrapper's default colors.</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these datasets:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kAtkOoa15IdWrdgNc-3rSP6in--SX8m-/edit?rtpof=true" target="_blank">Active duty troops</a>, Stimson Center</li>

		</ul>

		<iframe title="New York City has the most LGBTQ+ friendly spaces" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-h4WeG" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/h4WeG/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="571"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>

  
  		
  		<p>When you're done with both parts of this homework, return to Blackboard assignment step #4, and follow the instructions to get this on your Github page.</p>
